### MSCI 599 Marine Data Science with R
### Unit 2: Climate

Course GitHub site: https://github.com/MSCI-599

Unit 2 GitHub repository: https://github.com/MSCI-599/unit_2_climate

This unit will cover learning to program in base R. We'll explore data reading and writing, plotting, and simple data manipulation. We'll also go over boolean logic, if/else statements, loops and user defined functions.
